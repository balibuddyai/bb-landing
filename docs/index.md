## 🤖 More than chatbots or search  

Unlike traditional chatbots that follow scripts, Bali Buddy gives you **clear, personal answers**.  
General AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini don’t know Bali’s local rules or hidden gems.  
TripAdvisor and Google Maps often overwhelm with outdated reviews.  

👉 Bali Buddy saves you time with **up-to-date, trusted guidance** for life and travel in Bali.
